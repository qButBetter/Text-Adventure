                <p>
                    It's an early morning, and CART seems more dreary than ever. The sad, advil-like tones of Web
                    Applications slowly fill your vision as you approach the sign in the computer.
                    <br><br>
                    Everyone seems to be on edge; the air is tense and the keyboards are violently clacking beneath the
                    fingers of every web student in the room.
                    <br><br>
                    Sitting right in front of you is yesterday's assignment. 20 page website, with a prototype,
                    competitive
                    audit and all, which was due in a couple months. Now, it's due in 5 minutes.
                    <br><br>
                    Despite everyone's panic, the due date does not change. Most everyone rushes to finish, but only
                    manages
                    to get down one function, which produces an undefined return.
                    <br><br>
                    Right on cue at 7:45, Mr. Fast exclaims his frustration!
                    <br><br>
                    With his calm demeanor overtaken by rage, Mr. "he wants it done" Fast starts grading furiously to
                    get
                    the horrible scores into the gradebook. He yells as he grades, which causes a sonic-like boom in the
                    classroom, scattering his portraits across the CART space-time continuum. His rage—fuelled by the
                    terrible, but legendary, Powerschool—slowly took a hold of him. The rare instances of his
                    transformations had been rumored about by current Web students, overheard from the whispers of Web
                    students long, long ago. He had transformed into what the e-folktales deemed as the horrible,
                    dreadful…
                    <br><br>
                    <br><br>
                    Mr. Slow.
                    <br><br>
                    <br><br>
                    Mr. Slow utilizes his newfound abilities, granted by the PowerSchool grading system, to plague the
                    classroom and give all the cowering students still in his sight a “SUPER F-”.
                    <br><br>
                    <i>This is even worse than the Budget Calculator; or the Dino Dossier!</i>
                    <br><br>
                    <em>I need to get out of here! UX shares a wall, he'd probably still get me there! I need to get
                        help!</em>
                    <em>I'll go to IGD! I'll be safe there!</em>
                    <br><br>
                    IGD, filled with former Web students, seems to be standing on edge. A student sees your panic as you
                    rush in and approaches you.
                    <br><br>
                    “'Do not grieve, wise warrior! It is better for each man that he avenge his friend than to mourn him
                    much'.
                    <br><br>
                    We can fix this for everyone; it's in the legend. Did you see all of his portraits get scattered
                    during that blast? I think those are the key to turning him back into Mr. Fast. That boom was
                    massive… I
                    bet those papers could've gone virtually anywhere inside of CART. This one fell on my desk a few
                    minutes
                    ago, while I was designing a FNAF game with Beowulf characters.
                    <br><br>
                    The only issue is, you'd probably have to sneak past him to get them back on the wall. He's
                    definitely
                    not safe to talk to right now. Maybe you
                    should just do the failsafe thing and try to finish the project even though it's past due. Good
                    luck,
                    soldier.”

                    reversing Mr. Fast's overPower(school)ed transformation. Page by page, you piece his old self onto
                    the wall.
                    With the last page comes a blinding flash of light. Mr. Fast turns to you in a daze.
                    <br>
                    “What happened?”, Fast asks.
                    <br>
                    “You turned into Mr. Slow”, you respond.
                    <br>
                    “I don't remember that”, Fast retorts.
                    <br>
                    “Sounds like a skill issue on your end”, you say in a snarky manner.
                    <br>
                    He laughs at your response, which you delivered in a manner true to what he would provide you in the
                    same case. Then he steps over to the computer, adjusting something on the screen.
                    “Since you're all so behind, I'll give you the weekend to finish.”
                    On your computer screen, the google classroom due changes to Monday. Not the most time, but time
                    enough. With a sigh of relief, you collapse into your chair.
                    <br>
                    It's over.

                    Mr. Slow went down quickly, in stark contrast to his new name. As the sun slowly sets on the day,
                    you breathe a sigh of relief, and get a Baconator from Wendy's. You still go to school the next day.
                    When you come in, a substitute teacher waits for you, along with a new assignment. The assignment's
                    name?

                    In the hallowed halls of the Center for Advanced Research and Technology (CART), your loitering
                    transgression has triggered a cataclysm of cosmic proportions! The fabric of reality itself quivers
                    as the furies of idleness descend upon us, rending the very essence of innovation and progress. The
                    heavens weep, and the earth trembles as the curse of idleness consumes all hope of enlightenment.

                    <br>

                    Oh, hapless wanderer! Your dalliance and loitering within the sacred halls of the Center for
                    Advanced Research and Technology (CART) have invoked a curse of epic proportions! The very fabric of
                    innovation trembles at your audacity. The curse of loitering, a blight upon the noble pursuit of
                    discovery, has cast its shadow upon us all.
